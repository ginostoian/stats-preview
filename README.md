## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I used flexbox to create this layout as this is what I am starting to be comfortable working with. For some reason, I guess because I was distracted, I had some problems initially, but I think it turned out ok. It is not a 1:1 replica, but it's done by eye, with no documentation regarding sizes etc.

### Continued development

I am very fond of flex and I want to keep using it until it comes second nature.

I also need to do a bit more research into CSS Grid and try some projects with it.
